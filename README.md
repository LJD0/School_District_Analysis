# School_District_Analysis
##### Module 4 OSU BootCamp

    This overview is a summary of scores across multiple subjects for a group of schools in the area. The study spans both public and charter schools.

## First Look

    In general the scores do not show positive comprehension of the subjects. The averages for the entire set of Reading Scores come out around 72%, which is national average, but the Math scores are not. Math scores average around 64%. This led to looking into if there is a correlation between the school type, public or charter, and the comprehension of the subjects.

## Diving Deeper

    We analyzed the scores using several categories. First looking at grade and by school. We chose one school to sample from and look at reading scores. We found that the averages remained relatively consistent, while the spread tightened. Comparing the public and charter school we found that the scores remained consistent between them, showing that the type of school was not a significant factor in the success of the students.
    The scores also seemed to increase slightly as the grades level increased but still stayed very close to average.

## Limitations

    This study did not analyze the effect of school budget on the success of the students. School size was also not taken into account with this analysis. These factors could be the most important comparisons that were left out. 

## Summary

    Overall no predictions can be made with our analysis but there are several conclusions that can be drawn. Public and Charter schools both maintain the same level of education, regardless of budget differences. The scores increase as students progress showing that attention to class materials improves with age. 50% of the scores are between about 50% and 75%, showing tht there is not a high level of advanced comprehension of the topics. Further study could be conducted for a more rounded summary.
